## Deployment
 
* This project was developed using a GitPod workspace. The code was committed to Git and pushed to GitHub using the terminal.

* Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) or create an account
* On the main page click New and Create New App
* Note: new app name must be unique
* Next select your region, I chose Europe.
* Click Create App button
* Click in resources and select Heroku Postgres database
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "SECRET_KEY"
* Click Reveal Config Vars and add new config "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1"
* The next page is the project’s Deploy Tab. Click on the Settings Tab and scroll down to Config Vars
* Next, go to Buildpack section click Add Buildpack select python and Save Changes
* Scroll to the top of the page and choose the Deploy tab
* Select Github as the deployment method
* Confirm you want to connect to GitHub
* Search for the repository name and click the connect button
* Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and select the preferred deployment type
* Click either Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deployment when you push updates to Github

* As Heroku Student Pack no longer includes free access to the Postgres add-on I had to migrate Postgres databases from Heroku to keep ElephantSQL.
* Navigate to ElephantSQL.com and click “Get a managed database today”
* Select “Try now for FREE” in the TINY TURTLE database plan
* Select “Log in with GitHub” and authorize ElephantSQL with your selected GitHub account
* In the Create new team form

### Migrating databases
* Create a database
* Log in to ElephantSQL.com to access your dashboard
* Click “Create New Instance”
* Set up your plan
* Select “Select Region” EXAMPLE "EU-West-1 (Ireland)"
* Then click “Review”
* Check your details are correct and then click “Create instance”
* Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project

### Migrating your data
* Navigate to the Postgres Migration Tool repo on github in a new browser tab
* Click the Gitpod button to open a new workspace
* Run the script " python3 reel2reel.py" command in the terminal
* In a different browser tab, go to your app in Heroku and select the Settings tab
* Click the “Reveal Config Vars” button
* Copy the value in the DATABASE_URL Config Var. It will start with postgres://
* Return to Gitpod and paste in the URL you just copied into the terminal where prompted to provide your DATABASE_URL and click enter
* In your original browser tab, get your ElephantSQL database URL. Again, it will start with postgres://
* Return to Gitpod and paste in the URL where prompted
* The data will now be downloaded from Heroku and uploaded to your ElephantSQL database
* To test that your database has been moved successfully, return to ElephantSQL and select BROWSER
* Click the “Table queries” button. If you see any options in the dropdown, your tables have been created
* Select a table name you recognise, and then click “Execute”
* You should see your data displayed relating to the table you selected

### Connecting ElephantSQL database to Heroku
* In the Heroku Dashboard for your project, open the Resources tab
* In the Resources tab, remove the existing Postgres add-on:
* Confirm by typing in the name of your Heroku app when prompted.
* Navigate to the Settings tab
* Reveal your existing Config Vars. The original DATABASE_URL should have been deleted when the add-on was removed.
* Add a new config var called DATABASE_URL and paste in the value for your ElephantSQL database, and click Add to save it.
* Check the Activity tab to confirm


### Final Deployment 

* Create a runtime.txt `python-3.8.14`
* Create a Procfile `web: gunicorn lifestyle.wsgi:application`
* When development is complete change the debug setting to: `DEBUG = False` in settings.py
* In Heroku settings, delete the config vars for `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1`

### How To Use This Project
To use and further develop this project you can either fork or clone the repository.  


#### Fork GitHub Repository
By forking the GitHub repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository, by using the following steps:  

1. Log in to GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to fork.  
3. At the top right of the Repository just below your profile picture, locate the "Fork" button.  
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.  
5. Changes made to the forked repository can be merged with the original repository via a pull request.  


#### Clone Github Repository
By cloning a GitHub repository you can create a local copy on your computer of the remote repository. The developer who clones a repository can synchronize their copy of the codebase with any updates made by fellow developers with push or pull request. Cloning is done by using the following steps:  

1. Log in to GitHub.  
2. Navigate to the main page of the GitHub Repository that you want to clone.  
3. Above the list of files, click the dropdown called "Code".  
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "HTTPS", copy the link.  
5. Open Git Bash.  
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.  
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 4.  
```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY```
8. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.   
```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```  
Changes made on the local machine (cloned repository) can be pushed to the upstream repository directly if you have a write access for the repository. Otherwise, the changes made in the cloned repository are first pushed to the forked repository, and then a pull request is created.  
Click [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository) to retrieve pictures for some of the buttons and more detailed explanations of the above process.  


#### Project Set Up After Forking or Cloning  
1. Install all dependencies by typing in the CLI ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```  
2. Create a ```.gitignore``` file and ```env.py``` file in the project's root directory. Add the ```env.py``` file to ```.gitignore```. 
3. Inside the env.py file, enter the project's environment variables:   
   ```
   import os

   os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", <your_secret_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", '1')
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", <your_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", <your_key>)
   os.environ.setdefault("STRIPE_WH_SECRET", <your_key>)
   ```   
   You can get the keys from:
   - "SECRET_KEY" can be generated using [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)   
   - "STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY" and "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY" can be generated by creating a stripe account. The keys are found in 'Developers' Section, under 'API Keys'.  
   - In the Developer Section, under 'Webhooks', add a new endpoint.  "STRIPE_WH_SECRET". On Endpoint URL, enter:  
   ``` https://<your_host_url>/checkout/wh/ ```   
   Select to listen to all events, and create endpoint, and you can view your "STRIPE_WH_SECRET".   

4. Make migrations to setup the inital database operations.  
   ``` 
   python3 manage.py makemigrations 
   python3 manage.py migrate 
   ```   
5. Load data for the database or create data manually. 
   ```
   python3 manage.py loaddata <app_name>
   ``` 
6. Create a super user.
   ```
   python3 manage.py create superuser
   ```  
The project should now complete to run and can now be used for development. To run the project, type in the CLI terminal: ```python3 manage.py runserver```     

### Deployment to Heroku 
This project is deployed on Heroku for production, with all static and media files stored on AWS S3. These are steps to deploy on Heroku:

1. Navigate to Heroku.com, create a new account or login if you already have an account. On the dashboard page, click "Create New App" button. Give the app a name, the name must be unique with hypens between words. Set the region closest to you, and click "Create App".   
2. On the resources tab, provision a new Heroku Postgres database.  
3. Configure variables on Heroku by navigating to Settings, and click on Reveal Config Vars. You may not have all the values yet. Add the others as you progress through the steps.
